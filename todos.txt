1. change the SW geometry to be more like the heat converter geometry with heatsink chopped out
2. change the fluent mesh so that it's not so fine at the inlet/outlet, but same refinement at edges
(in fluent, use symmetry plane for the first point)
3. apply a constant heat flux to the fluid? can do it all within fluent to save time on sim for optimization rn
- make output parameter more interesting
- how the heck do I select all the pin faces...... maybe "everything except" type logic?
5. overclocking????
6. calculate what the flow speed should be in new SW geometry (50lpm) - done, 3.4646 m/s
7. make the text log update as solution progresses
8. fix unpickling
