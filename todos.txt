1. change the SW geometry to be more like the heat converter geometry with heatsink chopped out
2. change the fluent mesh so that it's not so fine at the inlet/outlet, but same refinement at edges
(in fluent, use symmetry plane for the first point)
3. apply a constant heat flux to the fluid? can do it all within fluent to save time on sim for optimization rn
- make output parameter more interesting
- how the heck do I select all the pin faces......
4. get more HPC cores for this computer holy moly
5. overclocking????
6. calculate what the flow speed should be (50lpm)
