1. change the SW geometry to be more like the heat converter geometry with heatsink chopped out
2. change the fluent mesh so that it's not so fine at the inlet/outlet, but same refinement at edges
(in fluent, use symmetry plane for the first point)
3. apply a constant heat flux to the fluid? can do it all within fluent to save time on sim for optimization rn
- make output parameter more interesting
- how the heck do I select all the pin faces...... maybe "everything except" type logic?, TUI script?
10. how do you clip to an irregular boundary? If you exceed boundary snap back to closest legal point - note this can't be set in PSO_param because the boundaries are defined by the combined math of diff PSO_params...
11. how the hecking heck am i going to map fluka to this shit (half heatsink)
