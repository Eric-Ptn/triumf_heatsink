1. make variable pin heat sink
2. change the fluent mesh so that it's not so fine at the inlet/outlet, but same refinement at edges
(in fluent, use symmetry plane for the first point)
3. apply a constant heat flux to the fluid? can do it all within fluent to save time on sim for optimization rn
- make output parameter more interesting
- how the heck do I select all the pin faces...... maybe "everything except" type logic?, TUI script?
- one-way couple remember
10. how do you clip to an irregular boundary? If you exceed boundary snap back to closest legal point - note this can't be set in PSO_param because the boundaries are defined by the combined math of diff PSO_params...
11. how the hecking heck am i going to map fluka to this shit (half heatsink)

steps
- do fluent meshing
- do one-way coupling
- test everything with one analysis
   - does it rerun the thermal analysis? - well yes, probably lol otherwise how is aluminum getting cooler
   - wait then the only way to actually save time would be to do thermals in fluent too right?
- work on irregular clipping in meanwhile
- once everything checks out do full analysis
